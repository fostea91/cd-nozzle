Convergent-divergent nozzle automated design code

This code will eventually calculate an axis-symetric profile for a minimum length, convergent-divergent rocket nozzle for a given set of geometric constraints and fuel.

The code currently calculates only the sonic line in the throat, where the throat inlet profile is either circular, parabolic, or rectangular hyperbolic.  It calculates the line using an iterative process.  The math is from the work of Dutton and Addy as published in the AIAA Journal, June, 1981.
